        "Base64" is a technique to store binary data (such as image data) in a
        text format that uses only characters of the ASCII alphabet. This
        technique is commonly used in browsers to handle images locally in a
        user's client/browser.

        What data does this website store in my browser?

        This data website stores the following data in your browsers own
        storage:
      </p>
      <ul className={"mt-4 mb-8 list-disc pl-8"}>
        <li>List of projects.</li>
        <li>
          Project settings (name, created and last opened dates, animation
          settings, SVG native embed setting).
        </li>
        <li>Project keyframes (position and size).</li>
        <li>Project images encoded as Base64.</li>

        Where does this website store the data in my browser?
      </h2>
      <p className={"mt-4 mb-8"}>
        All the data excluding the Base64 encoded images are stored in the
        Browser's "localStorage". This storage is only accessible by this
        website. The data can not be accessed by any servers nor is this data
        transferred by this website to any servers or third parties.
      </p>
      <p className={"mt-4 mb-8"}>
        The Base64 encoded images are stored in an "IndexedDB" database instance
        inside your browser. The images are stored in an "IndexedDB" database,
        because this storage technique allows to store big data objects (such as
        images). In contrast: The "localStorage" only allows to store data with
        at max 5MB. As images can easily exceed that file size, the "IndexedDB"
        technique is used. The database instance is only accessible by this
        website. The data can not be accessed by any servers nor is this data
        transferred by this website to any servers or third parties.
